When's My Bus/Tube/DLR installation instructions

Requires: Python 2.6 or greater to run the bot. Python 2.7 required for unit testing. Not yet tested with Python 3

1. Install Tweepy from https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy (run as admin/root)

    > git clone git://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
    > cd tweepy
    > python setup.py install

2. Download the code & data for WhensMyBus (this contains code for all three bots) from Github:

    > git clone git://github.com/qwghlm/WhensMyBus.git
    > cd WhensMyBus

All the geodata is there, you do however need to set up Twitter account and access keys separately

3. Create a Twitter account for your application

4. Log into https://dev.twitter.com/ with this account, and then click My Applications

5. Create a new Application. Fill in the details, you don't need to fill in a Callback URL

6. Once your App is set up, create an access token for your own account

7. WhensMyBus only: If you want to add the ability to geocode addresses, you will need an App ID from Yahoo. Get one from Yahoo!
PlaceFinder: http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/

8. Edit the whensmytransport.cfg.sample, go the relevant section ([whensmybus], [whensmytube], [whensmydlr]). Fill in the Twitter username, consumer key & secret, user key & secret, plus the 
Yahoo app id (optional, see above) and save as whensmytransport.cfg

9. You can also change the debug_level to DEBUG (more messages) and test_mode to True (it will read
Tweets, but not Tweet back at the users who made them)

10. You now have a working bot! To get started, on the command line run any or all of the following:

    $ ./whensmybus.py
    $ ./whensmytube.py
    $ ./whensmydlr.py

NOTES

* If you ever want to update the CSV file(s) in sourcedata/ and update the database, follow the instructions for import_bus_csv_to_db() in utils.py
* If you ever want to add the app to more Twitter accounts, follow the instructions for make_oauth_key() in utils.py
* If you ever want to run unit tests, run:
 
    $ python testing.py WhensMyBus
    $ python testing.py WhensMyTube
    $ python testing.py WhensMyDLR

  All tests should clear if a geocoder is installed; else the ones with placenames will fail
* Although only the Yahoo geocoder is used, there is code for Google and Bing's as well in geotools.py
