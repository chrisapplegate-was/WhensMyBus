When's My Bus? installation instructions

Requires: Python 2.6 or greater to run the bot. Python 2.7 required for unit testing. Not yet tested with Python 3

1. Install Tweepy from https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy

    > git clone git://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
    > cd tweepy
    > python setup.py install (run as admin/root)

2. Download the code & data for WhensMyBus from Github:

    > git clone git://github.com/qwghlm/WhensMyBus.git
    > cd WhensMyBus

All the geodata is there, you do however need to set up Twitter account and access keys separately

3. Create a Twitter account for your application

4. Log into https://dev.twitter.com/ with this account, and then click My Applications

5. Create a new Application. Fill in the details, you don't need to fill in a Callback URL

6. Once your App is set up, create an access token for your own account

7. If you want to add the ability to geocode addresses, you will need an App ID from Yahoo. Get one from Yahoo!
PlaceFinder: http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/

8. Edit the whensmybus.cfg.sample, fill in the Twitter username, consumer key & secret, user key & secret, plus the 
Yahoo app id (optional, see above) and save as whensmybus.cfg

9. You can also change the debug_level to DEBUG (more messages) and test_mode to True (it will read
Tweets, but not Tweet back at the users who made them)

10. You now have a working bot! To get started, on the command line go:

    > ./whensmybus.py

NOTES

* If you ever want to update the CSV file(s) in sourcedata/ and update the route & locations database, follow the
instructions in csvtools.py
* If you ever want to add the app to more Twitter accounts, follow the instructions in oauthtool.py
* If you ever want to run unit tests, run testing.py. All tests should clear if a geocoder is installed; else the last
one will fail
* Although only the Yahoo geocoder is used, there is code for Google and Bing's as well in geocoders.py
