Warning: the codebase is a bit unstable now, as we're still in beta and I'm adding in patches and bugfixes

The code works, but as of October 2011, this source code probably best for interested perusal, rather than
using in anger, until it's a bit more stable.

I will get round to writing a proper readme and installation instructions in due course. Bear with me :)
