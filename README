When's My Bus?
@whensmybus is a Twitter bot that tells you what time London buses are arriving at a stop near you
See it in action: http://twitter.com/#!/whensmybus

e.g.

    @whensmybus 135
...will check the Tweet for its geocoded tag and work out the next bus

    @whensmybus 135 from 53452
...will check the Tweet for the SMS code (usually printed on a sign at the stop) and work out the next bus

    @whensmybus 135 from Canary Wharf
...will check the Tweet for the departure point name and work out the next bus

This also works with Direct Messages
