When's My Transport

When's My Transport is a suite of three bots that tell you what time London's buses, Tube and DLR are arriving
at a stop near you. It currently runs as three bots:

@whensmybus  http://twitter.com/#!/whensmybus
@whensmytube http://twitter.com/#!/whensmytube
@whensmydlr  http://twitter.com/#!/whensmydlr

e.g.

    @whensmybus 135
...will check the Tweet for its geocoded tag and work out the next bus

    @whensmybus 135 from 53452
...will check the Tweet for the SMS code (usually printed on a sign at the stop) and work out the next bus

    @whensmytube District Line from Tower Hill
...will check the Tweet for the station name and work out the next Tube

This also works with Direct Messages so you can message privately.
