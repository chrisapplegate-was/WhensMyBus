When's My Bus?

Released under the MIT License

A Twitter bot that takes requests for a bus, and replies with the real-time data from TfL on Twitter

Inherits many methods and data structures from WhensMyTransport, including: loading the databases, config, connecting to Twitter,
reading @ replies, replying to them, checking new followers, following them back

This module just does work specific to buses: Parsing & interpreting a bus-specific message, and looking it up against the database of
buses and routes, checking the TfL bus API and formatting an appropriate reply to be sent back
