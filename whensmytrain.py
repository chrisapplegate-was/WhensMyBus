When's My Train?

A Twitter bot that takes requests for a Tube or DLR train, and replies with the real-time data from TfL on Twitter

Inherits many methods and data structures from WhensMyTransport, including: loading the databases, config, connecting to Twitter,
reading @ replies, replying to them, checking new followers, following them back

This module just does work specific to trains: Parsing & interpreting a train-specific message, and looking it up against the database of
stations and lines, checking the TfL Tube and DLR APIs and formatting an appropriate reply to be sent back
