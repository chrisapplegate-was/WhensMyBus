When's My Tube?

Released under the MIT License

A Twitter bot that takes requests for a London Underground train, and replies with the real-time data from TfL on Twitter

Inherits many methods and data structures from WhensMyTransport and WhensMyRailTransport, including: loading the databases, config, connecting to Twitter,
reading @ replies, replying to them, checking new followers, following them back

This module just does work specific to Tube trains: Parsing & interpreting a Tube-specific message, and checking the TfL TrackerNet API and
formatting an appropriate reply to be sent back

Things to do:
 - Review all logging and make sure consistent with WhensMyBus
